# E-Commerce-Web-Application

This is my first end-to-end Spring Boot e-commerce backend application.
During this project, I learned how real backend development works — handling requests through Controller, Service, and Repository layers, testing APIs in Postman, fixing authentication issues, and understanding how data flows internally.
Every error taught me a new concept, and this project.

# TeckStack-
Java,
Spring Boot,
Spring MVC,
Spring Security,
JPA / Hibernate,
POSTGRESQL,
REST APIs,
Postman (API Testing).


# Key Features Of The Application-

Client sends HTTP request

Request reaches Controller layer

Business logic handled in Service layer

Database operations through Repository layer

Response returned back to client

This flow helped me understand how data moves internally in a backend application.
